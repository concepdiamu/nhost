Level N is designed for students who have completed Level M or equivalent, and who are ready to learn more advanced vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension skills. Level N covers topics such as literary analysis, argumentative writing, research skills, and critical thinking. Students who complete Level N are expected to be able to read and write at a college level.
     
However, Level N is also a challenging level that requires a lot of practice and dedication. Some students may find it difficult to complete the worksheets on their own, or may need extra guidance and feedback from their instructors. That is why some students may look for the answer book for Level N, which contains the solutions and explanations for all the questions in the worksheets.
     
The answer book for Level N is not available for purchase or download online, as it is intended to be used only by Kumon instructors. The answer book is a valuable resource that helps instructors check the students' work, provide corrections, and give feedback. The answer book also helps instructors plan the lessons and adjust the pace and difficulty of the worksheets according to the students' needs and progress.

Therefore, students who are enrolled in Kumon English Level N should not try to access the answer book without their instructors' permission. Doing so may violate the Kumon policy and compromise the integrity of the program. Moreover, relying on the answer book may hinder the students' learning process and prevent them from developing their own skills and confidence.
     
Instead of looking for the answer book, students who are struggling with Level N should seek help from their instructors or other sources. For example, they can ask their instructors for more explanations, examples, or tips on how to solve the questions. They can also use online resources such as dictionaries, grammar guides, or academic writing websites to supplement their learning. They can also practice their reading and writing skills by reading books, articles, or essays on topics that interest them, and by writing summaries, reviews, or opinions on what they read.
     
By doing these activities, students can improve their English skills and prepare themselves for Level N and beyond. They can also enjoy the benefits of learning English, such as expanding their knowledge, expressing their ideas, and communicating with others. Kumon Level N is a challenging but rewarding level that can help students achieve their academic goals and personal dreams.
